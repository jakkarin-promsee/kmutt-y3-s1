Individual Sprint 1:
 React UI → Express REST API → Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL DB
 Sprint Goal: Build a tiny but complete vertical slice proving that every layer of the tech stack works

well.

1. What We Are Building Across Labs 1 to 4

TokTickIT is an IT service desk application for Account and Access, Hardware, Software, and Network
requests. Across seven individual sprints, each student will incrementally build the same product from
a full-stack foundation into a polished local web application.

The instructor acts as the stakeholder and product owner, releasing a new engineering contract for
each sprint. Every contract defines the required behavior, UI, business rules, acceptance criteria, and
tests. Students use AI coding agents to assist with implementation, but remain responsible for the
specifications, code, tests, reviews, and final product quality.

 Specification: defines the product behavior and design.
 Engineering contract: defines the specification plus the evidence required to prove it is complete.

The final application will support three roles: Requester, IT Staff, and Administrator. A Ticket stores
the current state of the request and contains related Public Comments, Internal Notes, Actions Taken,
and Attachments. Requesters and IT Staff share some functions, such as public comments and
attachments, while role-based rules control sensitive actions such as assignment, IT priority, status
changes, internal notes, and user management.

                                        -1-
By the end of Lab 4, every student should have a professional application running locally with
responsive screens, consistent UI styling, clear validation and warnings, safe error handling,
automated tests, GitHub Issues, feature branches, peer-reviewed Pull Requests, and complete
documentation. CI/CD and cloud deployment will be introduced later during the team-project phase.

1.1. User Roles and Role-Specific Actions

Each user has one user role. There are 3 user roles: Requester, IT Staff, and Administrator. The
Administrator role includes all IT Staff permissions in addition to user and reference-data
management permissions.

Requester, IT Staff, and Administrator can all:  Requester can:
    ● view permitted ticket information              ● create a ticket
    ● add public comments                            ● view their own tickets
    ● add attachments                                ● set Requested Priority
                                                     ● respond to IT Staff
                                                     ● confirm or reject a resolution
                                                     ● request reopening

IT Staff and Administrator can both:             Administrator can:
    ● become or change the Ticket Owner              ● view and search users
    ● set IT Priority                                ● create user accounts
    ● change ticket status                           ● edit user details
    ● add internal notes                             ● assign a user role
    ● add and update actions taken                   ● activate or deactivate accounts
    ● resolve and close tickets                      ● set a new initial password
                                                     ● manage Categories and Related Systems

1.2. Final Ticket Model

Parent entity:       Ticket  The Ticket header stores the current state, including:
                                 ● Ticket Number

    ● consistent color theme
    ● defined styles for labels, textboxes, buttons, grids, badges, and validation
    ● editable and non-editable field styles
    ● loading, empty, success, warning, and error states
    ● clear field-level validation
    ● unit, API, UI, and E2E tests
    ● GitHub Issues, feature branches, Pull Requests, and peer review
    ● complete setup and usage documentation

2. Lab 1 Learning Outcomes

    · Build a full-stack vertical slice: React/Vite/Bootstrap UI → Express API → Prisma/PostgreSQL.
    · Implement REST endpoints, automated testing (Vitest/Supertest), and Git Flow.
    · Utilize GitHub Projects for task tracking and peer-reviewed Pull Requests.

3. Lab 1 Request from Stakeholder

Here the stakeholder refers to the product owner, customer, or end user requesting this application.

 “Before developing features for this ticketing app, the IT department wants evidence that the
 proposed technology stack works as one integrated system. Create a basic TokTickIT application
 that displays the service status and the supported request categories stored in the database.”

3.1. Required Working Result

At the end of this lab, opening the frontend in a browser must show the app name and a [Check
System] button that when clicked shows the system status and the four request categories.

    · Backend status: Online, based on a real API call for health check.
    · The four supported categories loaded from PostgreSQL through the backend via API call.
    · A loading state (hour glass … “loading”) while data is being requested.
    · A useful error message when the backend or database is unavailable.

                                                                      -5-
4. Technology and Scope Constraints

Area        Required choice

Frontend React + TypeScript + Vite + Bootstrap

Backend     Node.js + Express + TypeScript

Database PostgreSQL + Prisma

Architecture REST-style APIs

Testing     Vitest and Supertest in Lab 1

Workflow    Git, GitHub Projects, four Issues, main/dev/feature branches, Pull Requests, peer
            review

Do not substitute another framework, database, ORM, or UI library. Playwright, authentication, ticket
creation, and image upload will be introduced in later labs.

5. IDE Use

For this course, students will use a VS Code-based IDE that includes an integrated AI coding assistant,
most likely Antigravity, subject to the availability of Google Cloud Platform support for the course.

Many development tasks may be completed with assistance from the IDE agent, including project
setup, Git operations, coding, debugging, documentation, and preparation of detailed SDD and TDD
drafts. Students are expected to use an AI agent / LLM to help make specifications, acceptance criteria,
and test scenarios more complete.

However, the AI agent is an assistant, not the owner of the work. Students must review, correct, and
approve all generated specifications, tests, code, commands, and Git operations. They must understand
each step of the workflow, know what they are asking the agent to do, and be able to explain the
resulting work. You may delegate execution to the IDE agent, but you may not delegate
understanding, judgment, or responsibility.

6. Lab 1 Execution Steps

    1. Setup: Find a peer reviewer, create the GitHub repository, and initialize main and lab1-staging
         branches.

    2. Planning: Create the GitHub Project board and the four Issues (Section 7) in the Backlog.
    3. Git Flow via the git branch structure: Use main as the stable release (production) branch and

         lab1-staging as the Lab 1 integration branch. Create lab1-staging from main and push it to
         GitHub. Do not develop directly on main or lab1-staging.

                                            -6-
    4. Create the GitHub Project: Create a GitHub Project named TokTickIT Individual Sprints. Use a
         Board view with these statuses in this exact order: Backlog, Specified, Started, PR Review,
         Fixing, Done. A status moves from PR Review to Fixing if it did not pass review; otherwise, it
         moves to done. Issues move from Started to PR Review and also from Fixing to PR Review.

7. Required GitHub Issues and Kanban Workflow

Create all four Issues (Tasks) before implementation begins. Add every Issue to the Project with initial
status Backlog. Move an Issue to Specified only after you have read and understood its requirements.
Move only the Issue you are actively implementing to Started.

7.1. Issue 1: Set up the TokTickIT project foundation

Type: Technical setup
Required branch: feature/1-project-foundation
Acceptance criteria:

    · React + TypeScript + Vite frontend starts successfully.

    · Node.js + Express + TypeScript backend starts successfully.
    · PostgreSQL is reachable and Prisma is initialized.
    · Vitest and Supertest commands are configured.
    · .gitignore and .env.example exist; secrets and node_modules are not committed.
    · Initial README setup instructions are present.

7.2. Issue 2: Implement the API health check

Type: Feature

Required branch: feature/2-health-check

Acceptance criteria:

    · GET /api/health returns HTTP 200.
    · The JSON response contains status = ok and service = TokTickIT API.
    · A Supertest test verifies the endpoint.
    · The React page displays the backend status based on a real API call.
    · A useful error message appears when the backend is unavailable.

7.3. Issue 3: Create and seed IT request categories

Type: Database preparation

Required branch: feature/3-category-seed

Acceptance criteria:

    · A Prisma Category model exists with id, unique name, and createdAt.
    · A migration creates the Category table.
    · The seed inserts Account and Access, Hardware, Software, and Network.
    · The seed is safe to run more than once without duplicates.
    · Database credentials are not committed.

7.4. Issue 4: Display the IT request category list

Type: Feature

Required branch: feature/4-category-list

Acceptance criteria:

    · GET /api/categories retrieves categories from PostgreSQL through Prisma.
    · The API returns each category ID and name in a predictable order.
    · A Supertest test verifies the response.

                                                                      -8-
    · React displays the categories returned by the API, not hard-coded values.
    · Loading and error states are shown.
    · A Vitest test verifies the category-list UI behavior.
Dependency order: Issue 1 must be completed first. Issues 2 and 3 may then proceed. Issue 4 starts
only after Issue 3 is available in dev.
